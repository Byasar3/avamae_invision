# AVAMAE Software Engineer Test 

## The Challenge
I had to re-create a small web app using React, based on an existing design:

- The desktop design can be found at https://invis.io/92U5LEC4HFW.
- The mobile design can be found at https://invis.io/7HU5N51T4US.

The app has three main pages:

- Home page: some static content, top carousel that loads data from an external REST endpoint.
- About Us page: purely static content
- Contact Us page: consisting of a form, which on submission should post data to an external REST endpoint. Form should be validated and behave correctly when API responds.

The app should also have a nav bar and footer. 

REST API:
- Root URL is https://interview- assessment.api.avamae.co.uk
- Documentation for its endpoints can be found at https://interview-assessment.api.avamae.co.uk/index.html.
